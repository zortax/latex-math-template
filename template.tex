\section{Introduction}

This is a \LaTeX{} Template for free usage. It is designed to be simple, straight-forward and easy to edit.
Basically everything you can see here you can also adjust to yourself. Just have a look into the \texttt{setup/$\dotso$} files. Enjoy!

\section{Packages}

I was careful to keep everything as clean as possible. This means that there are
no complications between the packages and only well developed and as few
packages as possible are used. Of course you can add your own favorites. But
with the existing ones most of the usual things should work.

The following packages are included by default and therefore can be used out of
the box:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{geometry} (for paper layout, margins)
\item \texttt{babel} (you can choose your language)
\item \texttt{setspace} (for line spacing)
\item \texttt{titlesec} (for title formatting \& spacing)
\item \texttt{fancyhdr} (for header, footer)
\item \texttt{xcolor} (for coloring)
\item \texttt{tikz} (for graphics)
\item \texttt{mdframed} (for frames)
\item \texttt{nameref}, \texttt{hyperref}, \texttt{cleveref} (for referencing)
\item \texttt{amsmath}, \texttt{amssymb}, \texttt{amsthm}, \texttt{mathtools}
  (for math stuff)
\item \texttt{enumitem} (for better list environments)
\item \texttt{lastpage} (to get the number of the last page)
\end{itemize}

\textsl{(if you do not like one of these you can also remove it, of course)}

\section{Math}

\subsection{Environments}

The following environments are included in this template. You can easily edit colors, spacing, fonts, rounded edges, numbering.
I do not show off everything you can do with the template here. Especially I do not show any kind of linking/labeling.

\begin{definition}[Group]
  Let $G$ be a set, $e \in G$ and $\circ \cl G \times G \to G$ a binary operation on $G$. We call $(G, \circ, e)$ a \df{group} if:
  \begin{axioms}[(G1)]
  \item dsadas...
  \item dads...
  \item dsa...
  \end{axioms}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  This is a proposition ...
\end{proposition}

\begin{theorem}[Cayley's Theorem]
  This is a theorem ...
  You can change the color to that it's different from the proposition. You can do that with all these Environments. Just have a look into the settings files. Also notice that you can add a name for the theorem (or for the definition; see above), but you don't have to.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Here we proof a Proposition, Theorem, Lemma or Corollary.

  You can also switch that q.e.d.-symbol downright.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  This is a lemma ...
  It goes with the same numbering as Propositions, Theorems and Corollarys. You can change that too. You can also turn off the numbering for single boxes.
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary}
  This \footnote{By default, footnotes are placed at the bottom of the frame. You can change this to the position directly below the frame.} is a corollary ...
  I will use it to show off the footnotes. \footnote{By default, the symbols differ from those of footnotes in the text. You can change this, of course.}
\end{corollary}

\begin{remark}
  This is a remark. I will write some more text here so that you can see the background color.

  Of course you can change the colors and also the frame around here too.

  Some more text...
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[to remarks]
  I want to remark that you can also add these names or labels to remarks, just like ``(to remarks)'' in this one.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
  This is an example! Examples are essential to learn something.
\end{example}

\subsection{Commands in text mode}

Commands include symbol shortcuts as well as templates for frequently-used symbol strings. You can edit them and/or add your own.

I will list some selected templates here:

\paragraph{Map Definition}

If you want to define a map in a clear layout, you can use:
\begin{center}\verb|\mapdefinition{map name}{from}{to}{variable name}{where variable is mapped to}|\end{center}
For example \verb|\mapdefinition{L_A}{K^n}{K^m}{v}{A \cdot v}| gives you:
\mapdefinition{L_A}{K^n}{K^m}{v}{A \cdot v}

\subsection{Commands in math mode}

\paragraph{Set Definition}

If you want to define a set, you can use:
\begin{center}\verb|\setdefinition{variable}{constraint}|\end{center}
For example \verb|$$ S = \setdefinition{x \in \Q}{x^2 < 5} $$| gives you:
$$ S = \setdefinition{x \in \Q}{x^2 < 5} $$
It scales automatically with it's content:
$$ A = \setdefinition{\frac{a}{b}}{...} $$
